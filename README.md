# Summer-Project-2015
#### Summary
This was my summer game project that I created. I worked on it here and there over the summer and it isn't totally finished but it still has plenty to showcase. Please Note that I did not create any of the character models, however I did create the staff that the main character is using. All code is my own although I did refer to multiple Unity API pages and other open source examples.
